# Learning-Java
I just stated to learn Java to become a Java developer. I decided to learn it myself using books and courses. This repo is for reviewing books and courses that i've used.

# Core Java
##  - Book: Hear First Java(2nd Edition) by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates
## - pros:
+ Using friendly language, analogies and visualization to illustrate concepts so it's very easy to understand
+ Exercises challenging enough to push me forward
+ They conversational style to teach concepts
+ Sometime, it's funny
## - Cons:
+ It's hard for referencing, so you should talk note
+ They put concepts in to analogies and dialogs, so sometime it's hard for me to see a clear definition. But you can turn it into a good thing by making your own definition.
+ This book teaching java 5 but this time of 2021 we have Java 11, but some people still recommend it, so it's not really a big deal, I think.
